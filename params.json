Further testing is needed to verify\r\nfull functionality and coverage. I'll mostly be adding and working on the software at this point.\r\n\r\nSee it in action:\r\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoSF4ZoDuRI\r\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9vEKyJScYw\r\n\r\nThere are some minor differences between this version and the original chip, mainly due to the hardware on\r\nthe board that I'm using. The design is targeted to the <a href=\"https://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?Prod=ZYBO\">Digilent ZYBO board</a>\r\nwhich has the <a href=\"http://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-7000.html\">Xilinx Zynq-7000\r\nSoC</a> containing an ARM dual-core Cortex-A9 and an FPGA. The board also has an \r\n<a href=\"http://www.analog.com/en/products/audio-video/audio-codecs/ssm2603.html#product-overview\">Analog Devices SSM2603\r\naudio codec</a> with dual 24-bit DACs. So the interfaces are different--the interface to the CPU is AXI4-Lite\r\nand the interface to the DAC is I<sup>2</sup>S, matching the particular hardware I have to work with. These\r\ninterfaces are wrapped in the design and would be easy to swap out.\r\n\r\nThe original OPL3 chip used a 14.31818MHz master clock. The sample rate was 14.31818MHz/288 = 49.7159KHz.\r\nWith 36 operator slots, that gives 8 clocks to update each operator each sample (operator logic is\r\ntime-shared between slots).\r\n\r\nThe SSM2603 on the ZYBO uses 256x oversampling, and thus requires a master clock 256x the sample clock.\r\nI decided to use a single clock domain and keep the sample clock as close as possible to the original\r\nchip. The ZYBO provides the FPGA with an external clock of 125MHz. Using a mixed-mode clock manager (MMCM) in the FPGA,\r\nI'm able to synthesize a 12.727MHz clock from that, which divided by 256 gets me very close to the original\r\nsample rate at 49.7148KHz. Updating 36 operator slots using my slower master clock only gives me 7 clock\r\ncycles per sample instead of 8, but that's okay because I can stack tons of combinational logic up with\r\nfew pipeline registers with this slow clock speed and modern FPGA.\r\n\r\nSeveral other very smart people put in a lot of work before me to get as close as possible to bit-true\r\nsoftware implementations of the chip, and this FPGA design would not be possible without their work.
